# manufacturer, model, trans, dry, fl, class variables are categorical
```

1c. Which are continuous variables?

```{r}
str(mpg_file)

# X, displ, year, cyl, cty, hwy are continuous variables
```

2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations?

```{r}

manufacturer_asTable <- table(mpg_file$manufacturer)
manufacturer_most_models <- names(manufacturer_asTable)[which.max(manufacturer_asTable)]

manufacturer_most_models
# dodge manufacturer has the most models


model_asTable <- table(mpg_file$model)

# caravan 2wd has the most variations

```


2a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.

```{r}

#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

manufacturers_models <- data.frame(Manufacturer = mpg_file$manufacturer, Model = mpg_file$model)
